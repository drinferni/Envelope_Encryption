# üîê Google Cloud KMS - Envelope Encryption Protocol (HSM-Backed Implementation)

This module implements the **Envelope Encryption protocol** used by **Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)** for secure key lifecycle management and protection.  
It leverages the foundational components defined in the `HSM/` directory:
- `AccessController`  
- `KeyVault`  
- `BaseCryptoProcessor`  

The system emulates how Google Cloud‚Äôs KMS interacts with an underlying **Hardware Security Module (HSM)** to generate, store, wrap, and unwrap keys using secure cryptographic algorithms.

---

## üß† Overview

In Google Cloud KMS, cryptographic operations are performed using **CryptoKeys** managed under a master key hierarchy.  
This implementation mirrors that design ‚Äî the **GoogleCloudHSM** class orchestrates CryptoKey management, DEK encryption/decryption, and ownership control while ensuring secure key wrapping through **standardized cryptographic algorithms**.

---

## üß© Components

### 1. GoogleCloudHSM

The **GoogleCloudHSM** class implements the core logic of Google Cloud‚Äôs **envelope encryption** protocol, integrated tightly with the simulated HSM environment.

#### üîê Core Responsibilities

- **CryptoKey Generation:**  
  Implements `generateCryptoKey()` to create new cryptographic keys.  
  - Supported key types: **AES** (symmetric) and **RSA** (asymmetric).  
  - Each CryptoKey is encrypted (wrapped) with the **HSM Master Key** before being persisted in the KeyVault.  
  - AES keys are primarily used for high-performance symmetric encryption, while RSA keys provide asymmetric key wrapping capabilities.

- **User and Ownership Mapping:**  
  Maintains a **persistent user-to-key mapping**, ensuring that each CryptoKey is accessible only to its owner.  
  Unauthorized users cannot perform encryption or decryption using restricted keys.

- **Envelope Encryption of DEKs:**  
  Accepts user-supplied **Data Encryption Keys (DEKs)** that are then:
  1. Wrapped (encrypted) or unwrapped (decrypted) using the corresponding CryptoKey.  
  2. The CryptoKey itself is decrypted from the vault, used for the operation, then securely re-wrapped with the HSM Master Key.  
  3. All mappings between DEKs and CryptoKeys are maintained in persistent files.

- **Persistent State Management:**  
  The module serializes user‚Äìkey mappings and DEK‚ÄìCryptoKey relationships to disk, ensuring the HSM‚Äôs internal state persists across runs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Supported Wrapping Algorithms

The **GoogleCloudHSM** supports the three industry-standard key wrapping algorithms used by modern KMS implementations:

### 1. **AES-KW (AES Key Wrap)**
- Standard: [RFC 3394](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3394)  
- Mode: AES in ECB mode with a **fixed IV** (`0xA6A6A6A6A6A6A6A6`)  
- Designed specifically for **key wrapping** with integrity verification.  
- Provides deterministic output and protection against key tampering.

### 2. **AES-KWP (AES Key Wrap with Padding)**
- Standard: [RFC 5649](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5649)  
- Extension of AES-KW allowing wrapping of keys with **non-multiple-of-64-bit lengths**.  
- Uses a variable IV (`0xA65959A6A65959A6`) and applies **padding** to align data.  
- Preferred for wrapping arbitrary-length key material.

### 3. **RSA-OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding)**
- Based on the RSA algorithm with **OAEP padding** (RFC 8017).  
- Provides **asymmetric key wrapping**, suitable when distributing wrapped DEKs across trust domains.  
- Uses SHA-256 as the default hash and MGF1 for mask generation.

Each wrapping algorithm is implemented using OpenSSL‚Äôs cryptographic primitives through the `BaseCryptoProcessor` class, ensuring compliance with cryptographic best practices.

## üßÆ Key Hierarchy

```

Master Key (HSM internal AES key)
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CryptoKeys (AES or RSA)
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Data Encryption Keys (DEKs)

```

This hierarchical encryption model mirrors **Google Cloud KMS‚Äôs keyring architecture**, where the master key never leaves the HSM, ensuring top-level trust anchoring.

---

### 2. GC_Server

The **GC_server** acts as the **backend service** of the emulated Google Cloud KMS.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Provides a secure **SSL/TLS socket interface** for client communication.
- Supports JSON-formatted API requests for:
  - `generateCryptoKey`
  - `encrypt`
  - `decrypt`
  - `transfer` (for sharing key ownership)
- Ensures message integrity by validating the completeness of JSON payloads before execution.
- Uses the shared `NIC` class for encrypted transport and message framing.

#### üîí Security
- All communications are encrypted using **SSL/TLS**, providing confidentiality and authentication at the transport layer.  
- Combined with key-level encryption from the HSM, this creates **defense-in-depth** across communication and storage layers.

---

### 3. GC_Client

The **GC_client** is a **testing utility** designed to interact with the GC_server and validate all functionalities.

#### üß™ Capabilities
- Connects securely to the server via SSL.  
- Sends structured JSON requests to:
  - Generate new CryptoKeys (AES or RSA)  
  - Encrypt and decrypt DEKs using selected wrapping algorithms  
  - Test access restrictions and ownership transfer  
- Displays the returned responses for validation and debugging.
