# Azure Key Vault Emulator

This module emulates the high-level behavior of **Azure Key Vault** used for securely managing cryptographic keys.  
Azure Key Vault typically uses **RSA-OAEP key wrapping** to protect Data Encryption Keys (DEKs) with a master Key Encryption Key (KEK) stored inside the vault.

This implementation uses classes defined in the `HSM` folder for low-level cryptographic operations.

## Components

### **AzureHSM**

This class is derived from the **BaseCryptoProcessor** class in the `HSM` module.  
It exposes APIs to:

- Generate **Data Encryption Keys (DEKs)** and register them in a simulated Key Vault.
- Create asymmetric or symmetric key pairs (AES, RSA, or EC).
- Wrap DEKs using the vaultâ€™s **master key (KEK)** with the **RSA-OAEP** wrapping algorithm.
- Retrieve, unwrap, or manage stored keys when required.

It also maintains internal maps to associate users with their respective keys, enabling fine-grained **access control**.  
Permissions can be granted to allow other users to utilize specific keys.

### **Azure_Server**

This component exposes the functionalities of `AzureHSM` through a **secure SSL socket interface** that accepts and responds with **JSON** commands.

It also implements **disk encryption and decryption** functionalities, simulating how Azure encrypts virtual machine disks.

The encryption is performed using a helper class:

```cpp
class DiskEncryptor
{
public:
    // Format a disk with LUKS (destructive)
    static int encryptVolume(const std::string& device, const std::vector<uint8_t>& dek)
    {
        return callCryptsetup("sudo cryptsetup luksFormat", device, dek);
    }

    // Unlock (decrypt) LUKS volume
    static int openVolume(const std::string& device, const std::string& mappingName, const std::vector<uint8_t>& dek)
    {
        return callCryptsetup("sudo cryptsetup luksOpen", device + " " + mappingName, dek);
    }

    // Lock (close) LUKS volume
    static int closeVolume(const std::string& mappingName)
    {
        return system(("sudo cryptsetup luksClose " + mappingName).c_str());
    }
};
````

#### **About DM-Crypt and LUKS**

**DM-Crypt** is a Linux kernel subsystem that provides transparent disk encryption using the device-mapper framework.
**LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup)** is the standard format for managing encrypted block devices. It stores metadata, supports multiple passphrases, and uses symmetric ciphers (like AES) to secure partitions or entire disks efficiently.

### **Azure_Client**

This is a demonstration client that connects to the `Azure_Server` using a **secure TLS connection**.
It performs the following operations:

1. Generates a new DEK through the server.
2. Encrypts a virtual (imaginary) disk using the DEK.
3. Opens (decrypts) the encrypted volume on demand.
4. Closes and releases the volume securely.

This client serves as an example of how applications interact with the simulated Azure Key Vault service.
